### Questions
1. Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci series. The program should work as follows: The user will enter on the command line the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate. The program then will create a separate thread that will generate the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that is shared by the threads (an array is probably the most convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution, the parent will output the sequence generated by the child thread. Because the parent thread cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread finishes, this will require having the parent thread wait for the child thread to finish.  
2. Write a multithreaded program that calculates the summation of non-negative integers in a separate thread and passes the result to the main thread.  
3. Write a multithreaded program for generating prime numbersfrom a given starting number to the given ending number.  
4. Write a multithreaded program that performs the sum of even numbers and odd numbers in an input array. Create a separate thread to perform the sum of even numbers and odd numbers. The parent thread mustwait until both the threads are done.
